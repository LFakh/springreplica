# Spring-boot E-commerce web app
backend : Spring-boot
frontend : React+TS+vite
just hit the command "mvn spring-boot:run" in the root folder and it'll run smoothly as it should;
It's a simple school project that i had fun making, feel free to use and edit as you wish as long as you'll always remember that I was built it here first ^^
